There is a test in tests/testthat/test-mean.R using testthat and there is a shiny test in tests/testthat/test-shinytest_app.R also using shinytest.
Running each testscript alone works fine. 
Running a package check with both tests included does not work, in that case there is an error. 
When excluding tests/testthat/test-shinytest_app.R from the package check, it runs fine again. 


We are currently using the following versions: 
R 4.0.2
RStudio 1.3.1056
Shiny 1.5.0
shinytest 1.4.0

But the same problem also seemed to be the case earlier R versions.


The folder structure in this package is exactly how we are using it in a larger project. It would be great, if we could use both testthat and shinytest with our current setup.
